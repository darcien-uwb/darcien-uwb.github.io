                <h3>Collaboration & Shared Leadership</h3>
                <p class="text">Good leaders find opportunities for their colleagues to shine. They take responsibility
                  for
                  bad outcomes and share credit for good ones. They provide support, constructive feedback, and help
                  resolve
                  any team issues. Good collaborators listen to their colleagues. They share duties, assist each other,
                  and hopefully, enjoy working together. Shared leadership is a combination of these: it inspires good
                  teamwork by allowing each member to take ownership of a portion of the project, ultimately creating a
                  quality, well-rounded product. The reflections below highlight my ability to collaborate and share
                  leadership with my peers.</p>

                <p class="text">In the presentation “Making Wyoming Renewable: An Impossible Challenge”, my team
                  discusses the
                  feasibility of Wyoming becoming a renewable state by the year 2050. Countering drawdown solutions with
                  the challenges of Wyoming being both politically conservative and coal and cow country, it was
                  concluded that Wyoming most likely would not change its ways anytime soon. I participated in this
                  group project during my first term at UW Bothell and did not know what to expect. As a returning
                  student, I felt comfortable initiating discussion within the group. My personal leadership style is to
                  allow others to select their preferred part of the project they want to own before I choose mine. I
                  enjoy the challenge of filling in the gaps as it produces a new learning opportunity. We checked in
                  with each other throughout the process, to assist and/or add encouragement when needed. While each
                  member provided research and content for their section, I volunteered to take on the additional task
                  of creating the final presentation, as I have a background in graphic design. Although new to Google
                  Slides, I was successful in creating a cohesive and consistent look throughout the presentation, tying
                  together all our hard work. We took turns presenting our sections to the class and were rewarded high
                  marks.</p>

                <p class="text">“Spider-Man vs. Batman” is a group project where we were tasked to create a pop-up
                  exhibit at a local
                  museum. Brainstorming concepts led us to compare the worlds of Marvel and DC Comics, using the Museum
                  of Flight as the venue. Requirements included presenting a concept document, usability report,
                  storyboard, and media examples to industry experts, with the final step incorporating our information
                  as a package. This was a big project and is a prime example of collaboration and shared leadership.
                  Two members of the team possessed strong personalities and significant opinions while the remaining
                  two members were more passive and agreeable. There were instances of managing control issues, where
                  one member in particular attempted to do most of the project on their own, but we managed to work
                  through them, ultimately dividing up duties, sharing responsibilities, and creating an amazing
                  product. We elevated our project by being flexible, incorporating ideas from everyone, and allowing
                  members to showcase their individual skills.</p>

                <h3>Critical & Creative Thinking</h3>
                <p class="text">Critical thinking requires challenging conventional wisdom, being insightful, examining
                  methods and
                  results, and analyzing not only how, but why. Creative thinking demands brainstorming different
                  avenues, thinking beyond the easy answers, being innovative, finding unique and original solutions,
                  contemplating non-traditional combinations and interactions, taking it a step beyond ordinary, and
                  pushing boundaries. Employing both critical and creative thinking allows for a richer project to be
                  developed.</p>

                <p class="text">The artifact “Socially Engaged Mapping of Home Community” uses Social Explorer to create
                  and examine two maps of the Columbia City region in Seattle, WA. These maps analyze two U.S. census
                  data sets from 2018: the population of students enrolled in public and private high schools in
                  Columbia City, and the racial demographics of the general population identifying as White Alone, Black
                  Alone, or Asian Alone in Columbia City. Using elements of map generalization, data classification, map
                  symbolization and abstraction, I demonstrate critical thinking skills by analyzing data and
                  identifying the following key findings: students residing in White Alone zones overwhelmingly populate
                  private high schools, students residing in Black Alone zones generally populate public high schools,
                  and students residing in Asian Alone areas attend both public and private high schools. Examples of
                  creative thinking skills are primarily displayed by finding a connection between these two variables,
                  and by not using default color choices but being purposeful in choosing color schemes that complement
                  each map.</p>

                <p class="text">My second artifact “Data Dashboard: Racial Demographics of Police and Population in the
                  United States” explores the claim “Do the demographics of area law enforcement agencies reflect
                  proportionally to that of the population they serve?” Components of critical thinking skills are
                  applied by examining the 2007 and 2016 data sets from Law Enforcement Management and Administrative
                  Statistics (LEMAS), determining if there is a relationship between the two groups using statistical
                  packages in R, being mindful of the relevancy of the topic in our current environment, and making
                  decisions on how best to examine and display the data. Creative thinking skills are showcased by
                  stepping beyond what was learned during tutorial sessions and designing an appealing layout for the
                  project, creating interactive visuals that not only display statistics but allow the user to engage
                  with the interface, and purposely simplifying the data so as not to overwhelm the user.</p>

                <p class="text">Good writing is inspiring. It creates a space to learn, disagree, or understand a
                  different
                  perspective. It tells a story, based on fact or fiction, and envelops the reader in that world. Most
                  importantly, good writing has a message. Good communication is invaluable. It adds both credibility
                  and clarity. It requires good listening skills and the efficient relaying of information. Good
                  communication can be effective in many ways, be it by use of words, art, or a combination of both. In
                  essence, good communication invites interaction and conversation. My first artifact is an example of
                  transforming a data set into a story whereas my second artifact is an example of using art as a form
                  of communication.
                </p>
                <p class="text">The paper “Data Dashboard: Project Proposal” describes the plan I use for my “Racial
                  Demographics of
                  Police and Population in the United States” data dashboard. Detailed sections include an introduction,
                  project timeline, data biography, expected outcomes, mockup, and a reference page. I was drawn to this
                  data set as it was relevant to our current world and I wanted to understand if the racial demographics
                  of area police were proportional to that of the community they served. Stating statistics on their own
                  can be dry, boring, and overwhelming. As a writer, it is important for the reader to understand why
                  the data is interesting and draw them in to want to know more. This led me to tell a story of the
                  LEMAS data set, researching its background and making connections to which people could relate. This
                  project proposal far exceeded what I believed I could do, without leaving me feeling overwhelmed. It
                  tells a story, is based on fact, and initiates discussion and communication among readers. It is a
                  comprehensive example of my writing skills.
                </p>
                <p class="text">In “Mental Mapping of Your Home Community”, I create a geo-visual representation of the
                  Columbia City
                  neighborhood in Seattle, WA. Based on my personal perception of space, experience, and knowledge of
                  Columbia City, I was tasked to be “true to yourself”. I initially found this assignment to be a bit
                  intimidating, overwhelmed by the endless possibilities of how best to showcase my neighborhood. But
                  then I got inspired. It was fun to reminisce about my old neighborhood, remembering my favorite
                  eateries, best spots to view the lake, and varying pathways to historical buildings. I started
                  creating my map by including these important data points, eventually filling an entire page of
                  landmarks that were important to me. Although this assignment was for a mapping class, I got to draw
                  and be creative, and not worry about scale or accuracy. Discovering alternative avenues to approach
                  projects and employing non-traditional solutions generates interaction between the author and the
                  reader. I look back at it now and am immensely proud of how I communicated my neighborhood to my
                  peers.

        <h1 class="mt-4 text-danger">capstone essay</h1>
        <h6 class="subtitle text-info">As you conclude your undergraduate education, what knowledge and abilities have you developed that you can carry forward? How does your portfolio provide evidence that you have the knowledge and abilities you claim?</h6>
        <hr class="mb-5">
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col">
            <p class="text">My path to completing my undergraduate education has not been a direct one. It has veered in many different directions, sometimes looping around wildly, generally resembling a Jackson Pollock painting. There have been many starts and stops and a few roadblocks to boot, but the experiences I have gained throughout that craziness have led me to here, this place in time where I am on the verge of becoming a first-generation graduate from a university that I deemed too big and overwhelming when I first set out on my academic journey. I am immensely proud of where I am today and appreciate both the connections and indirect path that have led me here.</p>

            <h6 class="subtitle font-weight-bold">Thoughts on IAS</h6>
            <p class="text">The mission statement for the School of Interdisciplinary Arts & Sciences (IAS) at University of Washington Bothell (UWB) reads that it “…provides a rigorous liberal arts education that draws connections across academic disciplines and links classroom learning to practical experience across diverse fields and sectors.” (https://www.uwb.edu/ias/about) This statement succinctly sums up my journey thus far: I have interests in many academic disciplines being a Mathematical Thinking and Visualization (MTV) major, with a minor in Mathematics and a background in Graphic Design; I have practical experience having participated as a Research Assistant for three projects ranging from “Document Co-Citation Analysis” to the “White Anti-Racist Project”; and my rigorous liberal arts education has included classes focusing on topics such as Introduction to Statistical Inference, Representation, Colonialism, and the Tropical World, and Introduction to Interaction Design. Pursuing an MTV degree has expanded my knowledge of the IAS core learning objectives and my insight in these areas will be demonstrated below.</p>

            <h6 class="subtitle font-weight-bold">Diversity & Inclusion</h6>
            <p class="text">When I decided to go back to school and pursue a formal degree, I had just returned from living abroad. I lived in three different countries during my time in Asia, traveled to twelve more, and interacted with people from all over the world. My knowledge of people, food, religion, and cultures were broadened far beyond what I knew from my upbringing and my local neighborhood. I learned from my time in Singapore that people from different cultures could peacefully co-exist. Living in Indonesia taught me that Muslims are wonderful people, contradicting the widespread belief held by many of my family and community members in America. The decision to include the paper “How Racial Hierarchy is Challenged in The Letter” in my mini portfolio on this topic was partly due to the fact that I had great difficulty watching this movie: its White-person perspective, inaccurate details of the locale, racial biases and overt stereotypes, made it troublesome to watch.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="col">
            <h6 class="subtitle font-weight-bold">Collaboration and Shared Leadership</h6>
            <p class="text">I appreciate feedback. I like to know the perspective of others, how I can improve personally, if I can be helpful to others. I like to apply experience of what has and has not worked in past group settings and apply it towards future collaborations. I like supporting others and watching them succeed. I aim to make connections with shy participants to help them grow and showcase their talents. I do my best to offer encouragement and accolades at a higher rate than constructive criticism. An example of my collaboration and shared leadership abilities is apparent in my artifact “Spider-Man vs. Batman”. This group project greatly benefitted from open communication in a safe environment. We encountered many bumps, from working with difficult personalities to ensuring the work was spread evenly, from allowing each participant to shine, to ensuring timelines were met. Ultimately, we were respectful of each other and produced an amazing project. Discovering avenues to overcoming our challenges helped me with forthcoming group projects and gave me some good points to draw from for future group endeavors.</p>

            <h6 class="subtitle font-weight-bold">Critical and Creative Thinking</h6>
            <p class="text">Critical and creative thinking both require unordinary thinking. Critical thinking involves analysis, questioning, and asking why. Creative thinking needs an open mind, brainstorming, and originality. My Mathematical Thinking and Visualization degree, by definition, requires both these skills and I was thrilled when I discovered it. I did not imagine I would find a degree that blended aspects of my artistic side with that of my analytical side, and my artifact “Data Dashboard: Racial Demographics of Police and Population in the United States” does just that. This project allowed me to further my knowledge of using R to create an interactive data dashboard. This dashboard not only presents information but tells a story. A story that is relevant and necessary in today’s world.</p>

            <h6 class="subtitle font-weight-bold">Interdisciplinary Research and Inquiry</h6>
            <p class="text">Merriam-Webster defines interdisciplinary as “involving two or more academic, scientific, or artistic disciplines”. Very few fields in today’s world focus solely on one area of study. To be successful, we must learn to be flexible and be capable of applying knowledge in an area of expertise to other disciplines. Interdisciplinary research and inquiry are innovative and creative by nature. I showcase my ability to perform interdisciplinary research and inquiry in my artifact “The Impact of Internship Credits on Student Success Varies Across Schools.” This project required understanding the provided data set, researching high-impact practices at UWB, preparing a hypothesis, creating data visualizations using R, analyzing our results, technical writing skills, and collaboration among group members.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="col">
            <h6 class="subtitle font-weight-bold">Writing and Communication</h6>
            <p class="text">Upon entering UWB, I did not consider myself to be a strong writer. It does not come easily for me as I would much rather do other things such as math or art. That said, I have worked at it and have produced work of which I am particularly proud. The artifacts I included for this mini portfolio are extremely different yet showcase a distinct range in my capabilities to both write and communicate. “Data Dashboard: Project Proposal” demonstrates a thorough plan for the data dashboard I proposed to create. I conducted research for the data biography, implemented a project timeline, and created a mockup of the design. I learned how to effectively present the information and tell a story. The second artifact included in this mini portfolio is “Mental Mapping of Your Home Community”. This is a completely different form of communication as it uses images rather than words. I created borders for my community that were unique to me, focusing on areas that were important and held memories. I communicate with emotion, images, and fondness for the neighborhood I once called home.</p>

            <h6 class="subtitle font-weight-bold">Conclusion</h6>
            <p class="text">This has been the right time for me to be at UWB and a member of the School of IAS. My time at UWB has been wildly successful and I have created connections with professors that I never would have during my time immediately following high school. The detours of COVID and immense racial tensions have provided an opportunity for perseverance, growth, and flexibility. I am confident in my abilities and the strengths I have acquired being a member of the UWB community and am proud of the indirect path of experiences that have led me here.</p>
