                <h3>Collaboration & Shared Leadership</h3>
                <p class="text">Good leaders find opportunities for their colleagues to shine. They take responsibility
                  for
                  bad
                  outcomes and share credit for good ones. They provide support, constructive feedback, and help resolve
                  any team issues. Good collaborators listen to their colleagues. They share duties, assist each other,
                  and hopefully, enjoy working together. Shared leadership is a combination of these: it inspires good
                  teamwork by allowing each member to take ownership of a portion of the project, ultimately creating a
                  quality, well-rounded product. The reflections below highlight my ability to collaborate and share
                  leadership with my peers.
                </p>
                <p class="text">In the presentation “Making Wyoming Renewable: An Impossible Challenge”, my team
                  discusses the
                  feasibility of Wyoming becoming a renewable state by the year 2050. Countering drawdown solutions with
                  the challenges of Wyoming being both politically conservative and coal and cow country, it was
                  concluded that Wyoming most likely would not change its ways anytime soon. I participated in this
                  group project during my first term at UW Bothell and did not know what to expect. As a returning
                  student, I felt comfortable initiating discussion within the group. My personal leadership style is to
                  allow others to select their preferred part of the project they want to own before I choose mine. I
                  enjoy the challenge of filling in the gaps as it produces a new learning opportunity. We checked in
                  with each other throughout the process, to assist and/or add encouragement when needed. While each
                  member provided research and content for their section, I volunteered to take on the additional task
                  of creating the final presentation, as I have a background in graphic design. Although new to Google
                  Slides, I was successful in creating a cohesive and consistent look throughout the presentation, tying
                  together all our hard work. We took turns presenting our sections to the class and were rewarded high
                  marks.
                </p>
                <p class="text">“Spider-Man vs. Batman” is a group project where we were tasked to create a pop-up
                  exhibit at a local
                  museum. Brainstorming concepts led us to compare the worlds of Marvel and DC Comics, using the Museum
                  of Flight as the venue. Requirements included presenting a concept document, usability report,
                  storyboard, and media examples to industry experts, with the final step incorporating our information
                  as a package. This was a big project and is a prime example of collaboration and shared leadership.
                  Two members of the team possessed strong personalities and significant opinions while the remaining
                  two members were more passive and agreeable. There were instances of managing control issues, where
                  one member in particular attempted to do most of the project on their own, but we managed to work
                  through them, ultimately dividing up duties, sharing responsibilities, and creating an amazing
                  product. We elevated our project by being flexible, incorporating ideas from everyone, and allowing
                  members to showcase their individual skills.

                <h3>Writing & Communication</h3>
                <p class="text">Good writing is inspiring. It creates a space to learn, disagree, or understand a
                  different
                  perspective. It tells a story, based on fact or fiction, and envelops the reader in that world. Most
                  importantly, good writing has a message. Good communication is invaluable. It adds both credibility
                  and clarity. It requires good listening skills and the efficient relaying of information. Good
                  communication can be effective in many ways, be it by use of words, art, or a combination of both. In
                  essence, good communication invites interaction and conversation. My first artifact is an example of
                  transforming a data set into a story whereas my second artifact is an example of using art as a form
                  of communication.

                <p class="text">The paper “Data Dashboard: Project Proposal” describes the plan I use for my “Racial
                  Demographics of
                  Police and Population in the United States” data dashboard. Detailed sections include an introduction,
                  project timeline, data biography, expected outcomes, mockup, and a reference page. I was drawn to this
                  data set as it was relevant to our current world and I wanted to understand if the racial demographics
                  of area police were proportional to that of the community they served. Stating statistics on their own
                  can be dry, boring, and overwhelming. As a writer, it is important for the reader to understand why
                  the data is interesting and draw them in to want to know more. This led me to tell a story of the
                  LEMAS data set, researching its background and making connections to which people could relate. This
                  project proposal far exceeded what I believed I could do, without leaving me feeling overwhelmed. It
                  tells a story, is based on fact, and initiates discussion and communication among readers. It is a
                  comprehensive example of my writing skills.
                </p>
                <p class="text">In “Mental Mapping of Your Home Community”, I create a geo-visual representation of the
                  Columbia City
                  neighborhood in Seattle, WA. Based on my personal perception of space, experience, and knowledge of
                  Columbia City, I was tasked to be “true to yourself”. I initially found this assignment to be a bit
                  intimidating, overwhelmed by the endless possibilities of how best to showcase my neighborhood. But
                  then I got inspired. It was fun to reminisce about my old neighborhood, remembering my favorite
                  eateries, best spots to view the lake, and varying pathways to historical buildings. I started
                  creating my map by including these important data points, eventually filling an entire page of
                  landmarks that were important to me. Although this assignment was for a mapping class, I got to draw
                  and be creative, and not worry about scale or accuracy. Discovering alternative avenues to approach
                  projects and employing non-traditional solutions generates interaction between the author and the
                  reader. I look back at it now and am immensely proud of how I communicated my neighborhood to my
                  peers.

                <p class="text">In this paper, Nelson develops a proposal for a data dashboard project. Using a data set
                  from Law
                  Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS), Nelson explores the claim “Do the
                  demographics of area law enforcement agencies reflect proportionally to that of the population they
                  serve?” She includes a description of the project, a project plan outlining task due dates, background
                  information about the data set, expected outcomes for the project, and a mockup sketch of the data
                  interface.</p>

                law

                statistical programming language), Nelson develops an interactive web-based site allowing users to
                explore trends in the racial demographics of local police forces and the populations they serve. She
                includes bar charts comparing demographics from 2007 and 2016, and scatterplots to determine if the
                race
                of the police force is representative of the race of the population.</p>
