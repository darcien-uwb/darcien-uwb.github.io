                <h3>Collaboration & Shared Leadership</h3>
                <p class="text">Good leaders find opportunities for their colleagues to shine. They take responsibility
                  for
                  bad outcomes and share credit for good ones. They provide support, constructive feedback, and help
                  resolve
                  any team issues. Good collaborators listen to their colleagues. They share duties, assist each other,
                  and hopefully, enjoy working together. Shared leadership is a combination of these: it inspires good
                  teamwork by allowing each member to take ownership of a portion of the project, ultimately creating a
                  quality, well-rounded product. The reflections below highlight my ability to collaborate and share
                  leadership with my peers.</p>

                <p class="text">In the presentation “Making Wyoming Renewable: An Impossible Challenge”, my team
                  discusses the
                  feasibility of Wyoming becoming a renewable state by the year 2050. Countering drawdown solutions with
                  the challenges of Wyoming being both politically conservative and coal and cow country, it was
                  concluded that Wyoming most likely would not change its ways anytime soon. I participated in this
                  group project during my first term at UW Bothell and did not know what to expect. As a returning
                  student, I felt comfortable initiating discussion within the group. My personal leadership style is to
                  allow others to select their preferred part of the project they want to own before I choose mine. I
                  enjoy the challenge of filling in the gaps as it produces a new learning opportunity. We checked in
                  with each other throughout the process, to assist and/or add encouragement when needed. While each
                  member provided research and content for their section, I volunteered to take on the additional task
                  of creating the final presentation, as I have a background in graphic design. Although new to Google
                  Slides, I was successful in creating a cohesive and consistent look throughout the presentation, tying
                  together all our hard work. We took turns presenting our sections to the class and were rewarded high
                  marks.</p>

                <p class="text">“Spider-Man vs. Batman” is a group project where we were tasked to create a pop-up
                  exhibit at a local
                  museum. Brainstorming concepts led us to compare the worlds of Marvel and DC Comics, using the Museum
                  of Flight as the venue. Requirements included presenting a concept document, usability report,
                  storyboard, and media examples to industry experts, with the final step incorporating our information
                  as a package. This was a big project and is a prime example of collaboration and shared leadership.
                  Two members of the team possessed strong personalities and significant opinions while the remaining
                  two members were more passive and agreeable. There were instances of managing control issues, where
                  one member in particular attempted to do most of the project on their own, but we managed to work
                  through them, ultimately dividing up duties, sharing responsibilities, and creating an amazing
                  product. We elevated our project by being flexible, incorporating ideas from everyone, and allowing
                  members to showcase their individual skills.</p>

                <h3>Critical & Creative Thinking</h3>
                <p class="text">Critical thinking requires challenging conventional wisdom, being insightful, examining
                  methods and
                  results, and analyzing not only how, but why. Creative thinking demands brainstorming different
                  avenues, thinking beyond the easy answers, being innovative, finding unique and original solutions,
                  contemplating non-traditional combinations and interactions, taking it a step beyond ordinary, and
                  pushing boundaries. Employing both critical and creative thinking allows for a richer project to be
                  developed.</p>

                <p class="text">The artifact “Socially Engaged Mapping of Home Community” uses Social Explorer to create
                  and examine two maps of the Columbia City region in Seattle, WA. These maps analyze two U.S. census
                  data sets from 2018: the population of students enrolled in public and private high schools in
                  Columbia City, and the racial demographics of the general population identifying as White Alone, Black
                  Alone, or Asian Alone in Columbia City. Using elements of map generalization, data classification, map
                  symbolization and abstraction, I demonstrate critical thinking skills by analyzing data and
                  identifying the following key findings: students residing in White Alone zones overwhelmingly populate
                  private high schools, students residing in Black Alone zones generally populate public high schools,
                  and students residing in Asian Alone areas attend both public and private high schools. Examples of
                  creative thinking skills are primarily displayed by finding a connection between these two variables,
                  and by not using default color choices but being purposeful in choosing color schemes that complement
                  each map.</p>

                <p class="text">My second artifact “Data Dashboard: Racial Demographics of Police and Population in the
                  United States” explores the claim “Do the demographics of area law enforcement agencies reflect
                  proportionally to that of the population they serve?” Components of critical thinking skills are
                  applied by examining the 2007 and 2016 data sets from Law Enforcement Management and Administrative
                  Statistics (LEMAS), determining if there is a relationship between the two groups using statistical
                  packages in R, being mindful of the relevancy of the topic in our current environment, and making
                  decisions on how best to examine and display the data. Creative thinking skills are showcased by
                  stepping beyond what was learned during tutorial sessions and designing an appealing layout for the
                  project, creating interactive visuals that not only display statistics but allow the user to engage
                  with the interface, and purposely simplifying the data so as not to overwhelm the user.</p>

                <h3>Diversity & Inclusion</h3>
                <p class="text">Oxford Languages defines <em>diversity</em> as “the practice or quality of including or
                  involving people from a range of different social and ethnic backgrounds and of different genders,
                  sexual orientations, etc.” and <em>inclusion</em> as “the practice or policy of providing equal access
                  to opportunities and resources for people who might otherwise be excluded or marginalized, such as
                  those who have physical or mental disabilities and members of other minority groups.” </p>

                <p class="text">I am fortunate to have life experiences that have helped me become a better human.
                  Living in three countries and visiting more than 15 over the course of 11 years allowed me to have
                  best friends and neighbors from around the world and make connections with people of varying social
                  backgrounds. I witnessed mosques next to churches next to temples and government-sponsored housing
                  where ethnic sectors were equalized. These experiences opened my eyes to the notion that it IS
                  possible to treat each other with respect and live together peacefully. As a Mathematical Thinking and
                  Visualization major and Mathematics minor, I believe it is imperative that women have better
                  representation in STEM fields. Racial demographics in the workplace representative of the community
                  provide opportunities for underrepresented ethnic groups to succeed, allow for new perspectives to be
                  formed, and offer a better understanding of the world. As a returning student, identifying as female
                  and a person of color, I check many of those boxes, and the following reflections reinforce my
                  understanding of the importance of diversity and equity in the workplace.</p>

                <p class="text">In the paper “How Racial Hierarchy is Challenged in <em>The Letter</em>”, I discuss the
                  concepts of orientalism and the “Other” by examining representations of tropical Asia in William
                  Wyler’s film, The Letter (1940). The first scene I chose explores the relationship between a White
                  male lawyer and his intelligent Asian male assistant while the second scene depicts a White female
                  character’s experience in the Chinese Quarter. This film is a study in what not to do yet
                  unfortunately is a common mindset of many who live in the United States. The White characters believe
                  they are superior to their Asian counterparts, appearing entitled and ignoring their opinions. Many of
                  the Asian characters adopt the derogatory stereotypes put upon them as a consequence of colonization.
                  Celebrating what makes us unique enrichens our lives. Making connections with those who are different
                  from ourselves creates a compassionate world. Respecting others and offering kindness are tantamount
                  to improving the world in which we live.</p>

                <p class="text">The White Anti-Racist Project seeks to comprehend the psychological change needed to
                  mobilize the White community in understanding their personal biases and how they unintendedly hinder
                  progress. The desired outcome is to help White people combat the psychologies of whiteness and white
                  supremacy. When I began my role as a research assistant on this project I was confused by the subject
                  as I did not realize the magnitude of the target group. I initially did not think it was a valid
                  concern, but the death of George Floyd and its aftermath convinced me otherwise. I was proud to be a
                  member of this project and look forward to furthering its message even when I am finished with school.
                </p>

                <p class="text">As the object of racial microaggressions from both family and strangers, as an ethnic
                  minority who has experienced being “other” both in the US and while living abroad, as a woman who
                  passionately believes women are equal to men and should be treated as such around the world, I have no
                  choice but to be an ally for promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace.</p>

                <h3>Interdisciplinary Research & Inquiry</h3>
                <p class="text">I did not realize at the time when I made the decision to pursue a Mathematical Thinking
                  & Visualization (MTV) degree at UW Bothell (UWB), that it was due to its interdisciplinary nature. I
                  was just excited to find something that incorporated my interests in math and graphic design.
                  Merriam-Webster defines interdisciplinary as “involving two or more academic, scientific, or artistic
                  disciplines”. In its description on its website UWB describes the MTV major as “draws on mathematics,
                  statistics, and visual studies to develop new practices and tools for discovering, analyzing, and
                  representing data.” My degree is interdisciplinary by definition and the classes I have taken to earn
                  this degree have challenged me to identify connections between these very different fields of study.
                </p>

                <p class="text">In the group research project “The Impact of Internship Credits on Student Success
                  Varies Across Schools”, my team determines if there is a correlation between the quantity of
                  internship credits taken by undergraduate students and their exit GPA within the schools of IAS and
                  Business at UWB. Team members incorporate inquiry into this project by conducting research into
                  high-impact practices, and demonstrate interdisciplinary research by creating data visualizations in
                  R, analyzing data provided by UWB, and calculating linear regression tests and confidence intervals.
                  This project utilizes skills in design, computer science, math, research, and formal writing and is an
                  excellent example of my interdisciplinary research and inquiry skills.</p>

                <p class="text">The research project “Student-made Models Analyzed on a Large Scale (SMALS)” uses
                  research techniques from data science fields to assess cognitive connections of important concepts.
                  Students enrolled in Statistics courses at UWB create concept models at three points during the term.
                  In my role as a research assistant, I then transcribe the models into a network of interconnected
                  concepts using CMAP tools. These models are then analyzed in R where the team creates archetype
                  modeling and visualizations to aid understanding of our findings. This project requires researching
                  best practices to both analyze and display our data, utilizing math formulas and R coding skills, and
                  engaging in research through inquiry.</p>

                  communication can be effective in many ways, be it by use of words, art, or a combination of both. In
                  essence, good communication invites interaction and conversation. My first artifact is an example of
                  transforming a data set into a story whereas my second artifact is an example of using art as a form
                  of communication.

                <p class="text">The paper “Data Dashboard: Project Proposal” describes the plan I use for my “Racial
                  Demographics of
                  Police and Population in the United States” data dashboard. Detailed sections include an introduction,
                  project timeline, data biography, expected outcomes, mockup, and a reference page. I was drawn to this
                  data set as it was relevant to our current world and I wanted to understand if the racial demographics
                  of area police were proportional to that of the community they served. Stating statistics on their own
                  can be dry, boring, and overwhelming. As a writer, it is important for the reader to understand why
                  the data is interesting and draw them in to want to know more. This led me to tell a story of the
                  LEMAS data set, researching its background and making connections to which people could relate. This
                  project proposal far exceeded what I believed I could do, without leaving me feeling overwhelmed. It
                  tells a story, is based on fact, and initiates discussion and communication among readers. It is a
                  comprehensive example of my writing skills.

                <p class="text">In “Mental Mapping of Your Home Community”, I create a geo-visual representation of the
                  Columbia City
                  neighborhood in Seattle, WA. Based on my personal perception of space, experience, and knowledge of
                  Columbia City, I was tasked to be “true to yourself”. I initially found this assignment to be a bit
                  intimidating, overwhelmed by the endless possibilities of how best to showcase my neighborhood. But
                  then I got inspired. It was fun to reminisce about my old neighborhood, remembering my favorite
                  eateries, best spots to view the lake, and varying pathways to historical buildings. I started
                  creating my map by including these important data points, eventually filling an entire page of
                  landmarks that were important to me. Although this assignment was for a mapping class, I got to draw
                  and be creative, and not worry about scale or accuracy. Discovering alternative avenues to approach
                  projects and employing non-traditional solutions generates interaction between the author and the
                  reader. I look back at it now and am immensely proud of how I communicated my neighborhood to my
                  peers.

              <p class="bibliography text-left">In this paper, Nelson develops a proposal for a data dashboard project.
                Using a data set from Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS), Nelson explores
                the claim “Do the demographics of area law enforcement agencies reflect proportionally to that of the
                population they serve?” She includes a description of the project, a project plan outlining task due
                dates, background information about the data set, expected outcomes for the project, and a mockup sketch
                of the data interface.</p>

              <p class="bibliography text-left">My intent for including this document as an artifact is to illustrate my
                skill in creating a comprehensive project proposal. This proposal demonstrates my style of writing and

                allowing users to explore trends in the racial demographics of local police forces and the populations
                they serve. She includes bar charts comparing demographics from 2007 and 2016, and scatterplots to
                determine if the race of the police force is representative of the race of the population.</p>

        <h6 class="subtitle text-info">As you conclude your undergraduate education, what knowledge and abilities have
          you developed that you can carry forward? How does your portfolio provide evidence that you have the knowledge
          and abilities you claim?</h6>
        <hr class="mb-5">
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col">
            <p class="text">My path to completing my undergraduate education has not been a direct one. It has veered in
              many different directions, sometimes looping around wildly, generally resembling a Jackson Pollock
              painting. There have been many starts and stops and a few roadblocks to boot, but the experiences I have
              gained throughout that craziness have led me to here, this place in time where I am on the verge of
              becoming a first-generation graduate from a university that I deemed too big and overwhelming when I first
              set out on my academic journey. I am immensely proud of where I am today and appreciate both the
              connections and indirect path that have led me here.</p>

            <h6 class="essay font-weight-bold">Thoughts on IAS</h6>
            <p class="text">The mission statement for the School of Interdisciplinary Arts & Sciences (IAS) at
              University of Washington Bothell (UWB) reads that it “…provides a rigorous liberal arts education that
              draws connections across academic disciplines and links classroom learning to practical experience across
              diverse fields and sectors.” (https://www.uwb.edu/ias/about) This statement succinctly sums up my journey
              thus far: I have interests in many academic disciplines being a Mathematical Thinking and Visualization
              (MTV) major, with a minor in Mathematics and a background in Graphic Design; I have practical experience
              having participated as a Research Assistant for three projects ranging from “Document Co-Citation
              Analysis” to the “White Anti-Racist Project”; and my rigorous liberal arts education has included classes
              focusing on topics such as Introduction to Statistical Inference, Representation, Colonialism, and the
              Tropical World, and Introduction to Interaction Design. Pursuing an MTV degree has expanded my knowledge
              of the IAS core learning objectives and my insight in these areas will be demonstrated below.</p>

            <h6 class="essay font-weight-bold">Diversity & Inclusion</h6>
            <p class="text">When I decided to go back to school and pursue a formal degree, I had just returned from
              living abroad. I lived in three different countries during my time in Asia, traveled to twelve more, and
              interacted with people from all over the world. My knowledge of people, food, religion, and cultures were
              broadened far beyond what I knew from my upbringing and my local neighborhood. I learned from my time in
              Singapore that people from different cultures could peacefully co-exist. Living in Indonesia taught me
              that Muslims are wonderful people, contradicting the widespread belief held by many of my family and
              community members in America. The decision to include the paper “How Racial Hierarchy is Challenged in The
              Letter” in my mini portfolio on this topic was partly due to the fact that I had great difficulty watching
              this movie: its White-person perspective, inaccurate details of the locale, racial biases and overt
              stereotypes, made it troublesome to watch.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="col">
            <h6 class="essay font-weight-bold">Collaboration and Shared Leadership</h6>
            <p class="text">I appreciate feedback. I like to know the perspective of others, how I can improve
              personally, if I can be helpful to others. I like to apply experience of what has and has not worked in
              past group settings and apply it towards future collaborations. I like supporting others and watching them
              succeed. I aim to make connections with shy participants to help them grow and showcase their talents. I
              do my best to offer encouragement and accolades at a higher rate than constructive criticism. An example
              of my collaboration and shared leadership abilities is apparent in my artifact “Spider-Man vs. Batman”.
              This group project greatly benefitted from open communication in a safe environment. We encountered many
              bumps, from working with difficult personalities to ensuring the work was spread evenly, from allowing
              each participant to shine, to ensuring timelines were met. Ultimately, we were respectful of each other
              and produced an amazing project. Discovering avenues to overcoming our challenges helped me with
              forthcoming group projects and gave me some good points to draw from for future group endeavors.</p>

            <h6 class="essay font-weight-bold">Critical and Creative Thinking</h6>
            <p class="text">Critical and creative thinking both require unordinary thinking. Critical thinking involves
              analysis, questioning, and asking why. Creative thinking needs an open mind, brainstorming, and
              originality. My Mathematical Thinking and Visualization degree, by definition, requires both these skills
              and I was thrilled when I discovered it. I did not imagine I would find a degree that blended aspects of
              my artistic side with that of my analytical side, and my artifact “Data Dashboard: Racial Demographics of
              Police and Population in the United States” does just that. This project allowed me to further my
              knowledge of using R to create an interactive data dashboard. This dashboard not only presents information
              but tells a story. A story that is relevant and necessary in today’s world.</p>

            <h6 class="essay font-weight-bold">Interdisciplinary Research and Inquiry</h6>
            <p class="text">Merriam-Webster defines interdisciplinary as “involving two or more academic, scientific, or
              artistic disciplines”. Very few fields in today’s world focus solely on one area of study. To be
              successful, we must learn to be flexible and be capable of applying knowledge in an area of expertise to
              other disciplines. Interdisciplinary research and inquiry are innovative and creative by nature. I
              showcase my ability to perform interdisciplinary research and inquiry in my artifact “The Impact of
              Internship Credits on Student Success Varies Across Schools.” This project required understanding the
              provided data set, researching high-impact practices at UWB, preparing a hypothesis, creating data
              visualizations using R, analyzing our results, technical writing skills, and collaboration among group
              members.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="col">
            <h6 class="essay font-weight-bold">Writing and Communication</h6>
            <p class="text">Upon entering UWB, I did not consider myself to be a strong writer. It does not come easily
              for me as I would much rather do other things such as math or art. That said, I have worked at it and have
              produced work of which I am particularly proud. The artifacts I included for this mini portfolio are
              extremely different yet showcase a distinct range in my capabilities to both write and communicate. “Data
              Dashboard: Project Proposal” demonstrates a thorough plan for the data dashboard I proposed to create. I
              conducted research for the data biography, implemented a project timeline, and created a mockup of the
              design. I learned how to effectively present the information and tell a story. The second artifact
              included in this mini portfolio is “Mental Mapping of Your Home Community”. This is a completely different
              form of communication as it uses images rather than words. I created borders for my community that were
              unique to me, focusing on areas that were important and held memories. I communicate with emotion, images,
              and fondness for the neighborhood I once called home.</p>

            <h6 class="essay font-weight-bold">Conclusion</h6>
            <p class="text">This has been the right time for me to be at UWB and a member of the School of IAS. My time
              at UWB has been wildly successful and I have created connections with professors that I never would have
              during my time immediately following high school. The detours of COVID and immense racial tensions have
              provided an opportunity for perseverance, growth, and flexibility. I am confident in my abilities and the
              strengths I have acquired being a member of the UWB community and am proud of the indirect path of
              experiences that have led me here.</p>
